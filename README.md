## Motivation

Understanding user behavior and satisfaction is crucial for improving services and identifying growth opportunities in the telecommunication industry. This analysis helps TellCo enhance user experience, increase user engagement, and make strategic business decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes user activity logs, network performance data, and customer feedback from TellCo's user base.

### Example Dataset Structure

- `user_activity.csv`: Contains user activity logs with the following columns:
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user
  - `timestamp`: Timestamp of the activity
  - `activity_type`: Type of user activity (e.g., call, data usage)
  - `duration`: Duration of the activity (for calls)
  - `data_volume`: Volume of data used (for data usage)

- `network_performance.csv`: Contains network performance metrics with the following columns:
  - `timestamp`: Timestamp of the performance measurement
  - `location`: Location of the measurement
  - `signal_strength`: Signal strength at the location
  - `network_latency`: Network latency at the location

- `customer_feedback.csv`: Contains customer feedback with the following columns:
  - `user_id`: Unique identifier for each user
  - `feedback_date`: Date of the feedback
  - `rating`: User rating (1-5)
  - `comments`: User comments

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and normalizing the data
   - Handling missing values and outliers

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzing user activity patterns
   - Examining network performance metrics
   - Assessing user feedback and satisfaction

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Creating new features from raw data to capture key user behavior and network performance indicators

4. **User Segmentation**:
   - Segmenting users based on activity patterns, network usage, and satisfaction levels

5. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Building models to predict user churn, usage patterns, and satisfaction

6. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Developing an interactive web-based dashboard for visualizing insights and trends

## Results

The results of this project include:
- Detailed user behavior and engagement analysis
- Insights into network performance and its impact on user experience
- User satisfaction analysis and key pain points
- Recommendations for improving user experience and increasing engagement
- An interactive dashboard for ongoing analysis and monitoring
